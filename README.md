The sole purpose of this silly game is to entertain my family.  I put it
together in haste (so the code is not up to my standards) and there are
a lot of copyrighted content in the repo that I probably had no right to
redistribute.  My only excuse is that I mean no harm, and may take it down
altogether.

Usage:
  * Click "Left" or "Right" to edit the team names.
  * The arrows add or take away 1 or 0.5 points.
  * Tapping a topic removes it from the wheel.  Tapping again adds it back.
  * Touching the spiral spins the wheel.
  * Clicking the pin on the top takes you to the first unanswered challenge.
  * Some challenges have hints which you can reveal by tapping the list item.
  * The checkbox marks a challenge answered and reduces the slice allocated
    to the topic.  If this was the last unanswered challenge, the topic is
    removed from the wheel.
  * To bring back the wheel, click the return icon at the end of the challenge.
  * The state of the game is preserved across reloads.  There's a button to
    clear it.
  * Both portrait and landscape modes are supported.
